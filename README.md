### Project Overview

This project involves creating a basic sales performance dashboard for a small retail store to track and analyze key business metrics. The dashboard consolidates sales data into an easy-to-read, visual format, enabling store managers and owners to make informed business decisions quickly.

### Data Sources

[View Here](https://github.com/onatolumayowa/CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK-1/blob/main/Online_orders_2024.csv)

### Tasks

- Calculate basic sales metrics like total revenue, average order value, and total sales.

- Visualize trends using basic line and bar charts (e.g., monthly sales trends).

- Identify the top 3 products by sales and visualize them in a bar chart.



### Tools

- Excel



### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Checked for duplicates
- Removed unused columns
- Added new columns 'Total price' and 'Order Month'



### Analysis

**1**. Visualize trends using basic line and bar charts (e.g., monthly sales trends)

![View Report](https://github.com/onatolumayowa/CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK-1/blob/main/sales_by_month.png)

**Insights**

- Peak Months: February and May recorded the highest sales, both exceeding $800,000, likely driven by seasonal promotions or high-demand periods.
 

- Lowest Performance: October had the weakest sales at around $120,000, with September and January also showing relatively low figures.
  

- Seasonal Patterns: Rapid growth from January → February Sharp dip in March, followed by recovery through May and June Decline from July → October before rebounding in November and December possibly due to year-end sales.


- Volatility: Sales fluctuate significantly month-to-month, suggesting strong seasonality and dependence on campaigns or external factors.
 

**Recommendation**

Leverage strategies from high-performing months to boost off-season sales, and consider targeted promotions during historically low months (March, September, October).


**2**. Identify the top 3 products by sales and visualize them in a bar chart

**Insights**

- Tablet 10-inch leads by a wide margin with $3,230,000 in sales over three times the second-ranked product.
  

- Smartwatch ranks second at $910,000, performing well but with room to grow.


- Mechanical Keyboard comes third at $495,000, indicating niche demand but potential for targeted upselling.
  

**Observations**

- Sales are heavily concentrated in one product, presenting both high revenue potential and reliance risk. 

- Also the steep drop between 1st and 2nd place shows potential to diversify and boost mid-tier products.



**Recommendation**

Maintain strong marketing and supply for the Tablet 10-inch, while developing growth strategies for Smartwatch and Mechanical Keyboard to reduce dependency on a single product.


**3**. Visualize the monthly sales trends of the top 3 product

**Insights**

- Tablet 10-inch is the primary revenue driver almost every month, with particularly high sales in May, June, and July. This confirms its status as the store’s flagship product.

- Smartwatch has noticeable contributions in February, May, July, and August, boosting total monthly sales during these months. Minimal or no sales in some months (e.g., March, October, November), indicating inconsistent demand or stock issues.

- Mechanical Keyboard shows moderate sales in May, June, August, September, and December, with peaks aligning to multi-product high months. Very low or no contribution in the first quarter except for a small presence in March.


**Observations**

- Sales spikes occur when multiple products perform strongly together (e.g., May, June, July).

- Heavy reliance on Tablet 10-inch means months where it underperforms (e.g., October) see a steep drop in total sales.

- Smartwatch and Mechanical Keyboard act as secondary boosters but have inconsistent monthly performance.


**Recommendations**

- Strengthen promotions in months where only one product sells well to balance sales across all categories.

- Address Smartwatch’s inconsistent sales and investigate demand patterns or stock availability.

- Explore bundling or cross-selling Mechanical Keyboards with Tablets to lift its contribution during weaker months.



### Overall Insights and Recommendations

![Dashboard Preview](https://github.com/onatolumayowa/CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK-1/blob/main/Dashboard_report.png)


**Overall Sales Trends**

- Peak sales occur in Feb, May, and June, with the highest revenue driven by multiple products performing strongly together.

- Sales dips are observed in October, mainly due to a sharp drop in flagship product sales.


**Top Product Contribution**

- Tablet 10-inch is the store’s primary revenue driver, consistently appearing as the top-selling product in most months.

- Smartwatch and Mechanical Keyboard contribute as secondary products but have irregular monthly sales.


**Monthly Sales of Top 3 Products**

- Tablet 10-inch dominates sales every month except October, with major peaks in May–July.

- Smartwatch performs well in February, May, July, and August but has months with almost zero sales.

- Mechanical Keyboard sees moderate contributions in the mid and later parts of the year.

- Strong sales months happen when multiple products perform well simultaneously.

- Weak sales months often coincide with Tablet 10-inch underperformance.


**Recommendations**

- Balance sales across all products by running promotions in months where only one performs well.

- Investigate Smartwatch’s sales inconsistency to improve monthly stability.

- Use bundling and cross-selling strategies for Mechanical Keyboards to boost their contribution.



### Quick Facts Summary Table


|Metric|Value|Insight|
|------|-----|-------|
|Total Revenue (Year)|$6,584,100|Strong yearly sales indicate healthy store performance|
|Best Month|February – $830,000+|Peak sales, likely due to seasonal promotions|
|Worst Month|October – ~$120,000|Lowest sales, possible off-season dip|
|Best-Selling Product|Tablet 10-inch – $3,230,000|Generates over 3× the sales of second place|
|Most Volatile Period|Jan–Mar|Sharp rise then steep fall|
|Product Concentration|~67% of top 3 sales from one product|Reliance risk, diversification needed|



### Conclusion

The sales data shows that the store maintains a healthy performance, driven mainly by a few high-demand products, especially the Tablet 10-inch. 

Revenue peaks appear to align with seasonal trends or targeted promotions, while dips suggest periods of low marketing activity or seasonal slowdown.

Focusing on sustaining peak months’ momentum and addressing low-performing periods could further boost overall sales performance.
